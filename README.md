<p> This is where we experiment and test out amazing feautures </p>
<p> coding needs time, patience, perseverance and a willingness to make mistakes </p>
<p> just imagine what 8 months of consistent effort and a daily practice would get you to </p>
<p> just think of that </p> 
<p> 8 months are 34 weeks, about 240 days, and two thirds of an entire year </p>
